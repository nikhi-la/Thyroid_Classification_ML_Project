**Thyroid Classification Using Machine Learning**

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are two critical conditions caused by insufficient thyroid hormone production and excessive thyroid hormone production, respectively. Accurate and timely detection of these diseases is crucial for effective treatment and management.

The *“Thyroid Detection Using Machine Learning”* project is focussed on detecting and diagnosing thyroid disease. The system is the comparative study of three algorithms. The performance of three machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine are compared to classify Thyroid disease into no thyroid, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism categories.

This project uses Flask as the backend framework to serve a machine learning model (Random Forest) stored with Pickle for thyroid condition prediction. The UI is built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, ensuring a clean, responsive design.
